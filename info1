This is for the OS work

We have Real Time, Non Real Time and UBI to consider.

We also have to consider optimization of these OS.

RT mechanism:
a) Priority based CPU allocation.
b) Doesn't use Completely Fair Scheduling (CFS) Policy.
c) Maintains consistent, low latency execution time
d) used for applications with extremely high determinism requirements.
e) RTOS makes a promise that no more than a specified maximum amount of time will pass between execution of subroutines. In order to do this, RTOS must also guarantee interrupt latency will never exceed a predefined maximum.

Non RT:
a) General Purpose Linux kernel.

Container Base Image:
a) what are the various options

RT support:
a) support with system tuning to meet performance expectations?
b) training Support?
c) bug fixes? do you branch out Ubuntu and fix bugs for customers?
d) RCA of field issues?
e) SLA with severity level definition?
f) validation and testing of any new Ubuntu updates?
g) how does the support match with the release? what is the oldest they will support? Full Support vs Maintenance Support vs Extended Lifecycle Support.
h) how do you support ubinize
i) upgrade for host OS support?  and its upgrade flow compatibility with base OS.
j) upgrade for base OS support? and its upgrade flow compatibility with host OS.




Non-RT Support:
a)


Related Concepts:
a) CPU isolation and thread affinity (CPU pinning)
